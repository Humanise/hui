# HUI guidelines

## States

* normal
* disabled
* highlighted

## Sizes

* micro (proposed)
* tiny
* mini
* regular (default)
* large
* huge (proposed)
* giga (proposed)

Sizes should probably either be set as booleans mini=true or size="mini" both should be possible.

Maybe sizes should be inherited in some cases â€“ maybe config via inherit: true/false
