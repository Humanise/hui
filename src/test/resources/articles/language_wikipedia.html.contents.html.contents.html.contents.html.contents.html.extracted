<h1>Language - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h1><p>Language is the <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a> capacity for acquiring and using complex systems of <a href="/wiki/Communication" title="Communication">communication</a>, and a language is any example of such a system of complex communication. The scientific study of language is called <a href="/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a>. It is impossible to know precisely how many languages there are in the world, and the number depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and <a href="/wiki/Dialects" title="Dialects">dialects</a>. However, estimates vary between around 6,000 and 7,000 languages in number. <a href="/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">Natural languages</a> are <a href="/wiki/Speech" title="Speech">spoken</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sign_language" title="Sign language">signed</a>, but any language can be en<a href="/wiki/Code" title="Code">coded</a> into secondary media using auditory, visual or tactile <a href="/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)" title="Stimulus (physiology)">stimuli</a>, for example in <a href="/wiki/Written_language" title="Written language">graphic writing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Braille" title="Braille">braille</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Whistled_language" title="Whistled language">whistling</a>. This is because human language is modality-independent. When used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the <a href="/wiki/Cognitive" title="Cognitive">cognitive</a> ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules.</p><p>Human language is unique among the lifeforms of Earth because its complex structure affords a much wider range of possible expressions and uses than any known system of <a href="/wiki/Animal_communication" title="Animal communication">animal communication</a>, all of which are generally closed systems, with limited functions and mostly genetically rather than socially transmitted. In contrast to non-human communication forms, human language has the properties of <a href="/wiki/Productivity_(linguistics)" title="Productivity (linguistics)">productivity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Recursivity" title="Recursivity">recursivity</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Displacement_(linguistics)" title="Displacement (linguistics)">displacement</a>. Human language is also the only system to rely mostly on social convention and learning. Language is thought to have originated when early <a href="/wiki/Hominin" title="Hominin">hominins</a> first started cooperating, gradually changing their primate communication systems as they acquired the ability to form a <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_mind" title="Theory of mind">theory of other minds</a> and shared <a href="/wiki/Intentionality" title="Intentionality">intentionality</a>.</p><p>This development is thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the <a href="/wiki/Human_brain" title="Human brain">human brain</a>, but especially in <a href="/wiki/Broca%27s_area" title="Broca's area">Broca’s</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wernicke%27s_area" title="Wernicke's area">Wernicke’s areas</a>. Humans <a href="/wiki/Language_acquisition" title="Language acquisition">acquire</a> language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are around three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human <a href="/wiki/Culture" title="Culture">culture</a>. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group <a href="/wiki/Identity_(social_science)" title="Identity (social science)">identity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_stratification" title="Social stratification">social stratification</a>, as well as for <a href="/wiki/Social_grooming" title="Social grooming">social grooming</a> and <a href="/wiki/Entertainment" title="Entertainment">entertainment</a>.</p><p>All languages rely on the process of <a href="/wiki/Semiosis" title="Semiosis">semiosis</a> to relate <a href="/wiki/Sign_(linguistics)" title="Sign (linguistics)">signs</a> with particular <a href="/wiki/Meaning_(linguistics)" title="Meaning (linguistics)">meanings</a>. <a href="/wiki/Oral_language" title="Oral language">Oral</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sign_language" title="Sign language">sign languages</a> contain a <a href="/wiki/Phonology" title="Phonology">phonological</a> system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or <a href="/wiki/Morpheme" title="Morpheme">morphemes</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Syntax" title="Syntax">syntactic</a> system that governs how words and <a href="/wiki/Morphemes" title="Morphemes">morphemes</a> are combined to form phrases and utterances. Languages <a href="/wiki/Language_change" title="Language change">evolve</a> and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by <a href="/wiki/Historical_linguistics" title="Historical linguistics">comparing</a> modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had for the later stages to have occurred. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a <a href="/wiki/Language_family" title="Language family">language family</a>.

Communication systems used by other animals such as <a href="/wiki/Bee_learning_and_communication" title="Bee learning and communication">bees</a> or non-human <a href="/wiki/Great_ape_language" title="Great ape language">apes</a> are closed systems that consist of a closed number of possible things that can be expressed.<a href="#cite_note-16">[17]</a></p><p>In contrast human language is open-ended and <a href="/wiki/Productivity_(linguistics)" title="Productivity (linguistics)">productive</a>, meaning that it allows humans to produce an infinite set of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This we can do because human language is based on a dual code, where a finite number of meaningless elements (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form units of meaning (words and sentences).<a href="#cite_note-Trask5-17">[18]</a> Furthermore the symbols and grammatical rules of any particular language are largely arbitrary, meaning that the system can only be acquired through social interaction.<a href="#cite_note-18">[19]</a> The known systems of communication used by animals, on the other hand, can only express a finite number of utterances that are mostly genetically transmitted.<a href="#cite_note-Tomasello_2008-19">[20]</a></p><p>Several species of animals have proven able to acquire forms of communication through social learning, such as the <a href="/wiki/Bonobo" title="Bonobo">Bonobo</a><a href="/wiki/Kanzi" title="Kanzi">Kanzi</a> who learned to express himself using a set of symbolic <a href="/wiki/Lexigram" title="Lexigram">lexigrams</a>.

However while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,<a href="#cite_note-20">[21]</a> none have been able to learn as many different signs as is generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.<a href="#cite_note-Deacon_1997-21">[22]</a></p><p>Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ <a href="/wiki/Grammatical_categories" title="Grammatical categories">grammatical and semantic categories</a> such as noun and verb, or present and past, to express exceedingly complex meanings.<a href="#cite_note-Deacon_1997-21">[22]</a> Human language is also unique in having the property of <a href="/wiki/Recursion#Recursion_in_language" title="Recursion">recursivity</a>; this is the way in which, for example, a noun phrase to contain another noun phrase (as in "[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]]") or a clause to contain a clause (as in "[I see [the dog is running]]").<a href="#cite_note-22">[23]</a> Human language is also the only known natural communication system that is modality independent, meaning that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several - for example spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas <a href="/wiki/Sign_language" title="Sign language">sign languages</a> and writing use the visual modality and <a href="/wiki/Braille" title="Braille">braille</a> writing uses the tactile modality.<a href="#cite_note-23">[24]</a></p><p>With regards to the meaning that it may convey and the cognitive operations that it builds on, human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events, as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called <a href="/wiki/Displacement_(linguistics)" title="Displacement (linguistics)">displacement</a>, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of <a href="/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">bees</a> that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.<a href="#cite_note-Trask5-17">[18]</a></p><h2>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Origin">edit</a>] Origin</h2><p>Theories about the origin of language can be divided according to their basic assumptions. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one can not imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared fairly suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, some theories see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, while others see it as a system that is largely cultural, that is learned through social interaction.<a href="#cite_note-25">[26]</a></p><p>Currently the only prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher <a href="/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>. Chomsky proposes that 'some random mutation took place, maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower, and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain'. While cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that 'it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language'.<a href="#cite_note-26">[27]</a></p><p>Continuity-based theories are currently held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development.

Both Broca's and Wenicke's aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with Broca's aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with Wernicke's aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs.

This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (<a href="/wiki/Larynx" title="Larynx">larynx</a>) and the upper vocal tract - the throat, the mouth and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.<a href="#cite_note-45">[46]</a></p><p>The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of <a href="/wiki/Segment_(linguistics)" title="Segment (linguistics)">segmental and suprasegmental</a> elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, and which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants.

Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example in sounds, images or gestures, and they come to be related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.</p><p>Thus languages must have a <a href="/wiki/Vocabulary" title="Vocabulary">vocabulary</a> of signs related to specific meaning—the English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species <a href="/wiki/Canis_familiaris" title="Canis familiaris">Canis familiaris</a>.

In English for example the words /bat/ [bat] and /pat/ [pʰat] form a minimal pair in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates the two words as having different meanings. But each language contrasts sounds in different ways: for example in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants the sounds [p] and [b] would be considered a single phoneme and consequently the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between <a href="/wiki/Aspiration_(linguistics)" title="Aspiration (linguistics)">aspirated and non-aspirated</a> pronunciations of consonants as many other languages do: the unaspirated /p/ in /spin/ [spin] and the aspirated /p/ in /pin/ [pʰin] are considered as merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called <a href="/wiki/Allophones" title="Allophones">allophones</a>), whereas in <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese" title="Mandarin Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [pʰá] "crouch" and [pá] "eight" (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).<a href="#cite_note-Trask214-60">[61]</a></p><p>All <a href="/wiki/Oral_language" title="Oral language">spoken languages</a> have phonemes of at least two different categories, <a href="/wiki/Vowels" title="Vowels">vowels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Consonants" title="Consonants">consonants</a>, that can be combined to form <a href="/wiki/Syllable" title="Syllable">syllables</a>.<a href="#cite_note-MacMahon5-46">[47]</a> As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning.

All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denote things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denote actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song," are usually called <a href="/wiki/Noun" title="Noun">nouns</a>. The second, which includes "run" and "sing," are called <a href="/wiki/Verb" title="Verb">verbs</a>. An other common category is the <a href="/wiki/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjective</a>, words that describe properties or qualities of nouns such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open", if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed", if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since infinite numbers of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix "noun-like").

In a sentence such as "Sally runs," the predicate is "runs," because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally." Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John." A predicate that can only take a single argument is called <a href="/wiki/Transitivity_(grammar)" title="Transitivity (grammar)">intransitive</a>, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called <a href="/wiki/Transitive_verb" title="Transitive verb">transitive</a>.<a href="#cite_note-70">[71]</a></p><p>Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as <a href="/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar)" title="Conjunction (grammar)">conjunctions</a> that serve to join two sentences and <a href="/wiki/Article_(grammar)" title="Article (grammar)">articles</a> that introduces a noun, <a href="/wiki/Interjections" title="Interjections">interjections</a> such as "agh!" or "wow!", or <a href="/wiki/Ideophones" title="Ideophones">ideophones</a> that mimic the sound of some event.

In English the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung" which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer" which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".<a href="#cite_note-72">[73]</a><a href="#cite_note-73">[74]</a></p><p>Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example Chinese, there are no morphological processes and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called <a href="/wiki/Isolating_language" title="Isolating language">isolating</a>, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example in Latin the word bonus "good" consists of the root bon- meaning "good" and the suffix -us which means masculine gender, singular number and <a href="/wiki/Nominative" title="Nominative">nominative</a> case. These languages are called <a href="/wiki/Fusional_languages" title="Fusional languages">fusional languages</a>, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite type of fusional languages are <a href="/wiki/Agglutinative_languages" title="Agglutinative languages">agglutinative languages</a> which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is <a href="/wiki/Turkish_language" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>, where for example the word evlerinizden "from your houses" consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called <a href="/wiki/Polysynthetic_languages" title="Polysynthetic languages">polysynthetic languages</a>. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example the <a href="/wiki/Yupik_language" title="Yupik language">Yupik</a> word tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer." The word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative, and except for the morpheme tuntu "reindeer", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.<a href="#cite_note-74">[75]</a></p><p>Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called <a href="/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics)" title="Agreement (linguistics)">agreement</a>. For example, in many Indo-European languages adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus "good" is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender and singular. In many polysynthetic languages verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example in the <a href="/wiki/Basque_language" title="Basque language">Basque</a> phrase ikusi nauzu "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the -zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"<a href="#cite_note-75">[76]</a></p><h4>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21" title="Edit section: Syntax">edit</a>] Syntax</h4><p>Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. It is the syntactical rules of a language that determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful but "*love you I" is not<a href="#cite_note-76">[77]</a>: syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.<a href="#cite_note-77">[78]</a> For example, in English the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. But in <a href="/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a> both Dominus servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because servos "slaves" is in the <a href="/wiki/Accusative_case" title="Accusative case">accusative case</a> showing that they are the <a href="/wiki/Object_(grammar)" title="Object (grammar)">grammatical object</a> of the sentence and dominus "master" is in the <a href="/wiki/Nominative_case" title="Nominative case">nominative case</a> showing that he is the subject.<a href="#cite_note-78">[79]</a></p><p>Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of <a href="/wiki/Wh-movement" title="Wh-movement">inverse word order in questions</a> which exists in many languages. This rule is the reason that in English, when the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question it becomes "Who is John talking to?" and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing <a href="/wiki/Focus_(linguistics)" title="Focus (linguistics)">special emphasis</a> on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called <a href="/wiki/Phrase" title="Phrase">phrases</a>, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.<a href="#cite_note-79">[80]</a> To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analysed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase; and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.<a href="#cite_note-80">[81]</a></p><p>The reason sentences can be seen as composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations are carried out. For example "the cat" is one phrase and "on the mat" is another because they would be treated as single units if we decided to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".<a href="#cite_note-81">[82]</a> There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.<a href="#cite_note-NewmeyerForm-13">[14]</a></p><h3>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22" title="Edit section: Typology: universals and diversity">edit</a>] Typology: universals and diversity</h3><p>Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types.

In English the basic order is <a href="/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object" title="Subject–verb–object">SVO</a> "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example the corresponding sentence in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_languages" title="Australian Aboriginal languages">Australian language</a><a href="/wiki/Gamilaraay_language" title="Gamilaraay language">Gamilaraay</a> would be "d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy" (Snake Man Bit), <a href="/wiki/Subject-object-verb" title="Subject-object-verb">SOV</a>.<a href="#cite_note-CroftErg-83">[84]</a> Word order type is relevant as a typological parameters because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of prepositions of postpositions. Such correlations are called <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_universals" title="Linguistic universals">implicational universals</a>. For example most (but not all) languages that are of the <a href="/wiki/Subject-object-verb" title="Subject-object-verb">SOV</a> type have <a href="/wiki/Postposition" title="Postposition">postpositions</a> rather than <a href="/wiki/Preposition" title="Preposition">prepositions</a>, and have adjectives before nouns.<a href="#cite_note-84">[85]</a></p><p>Through the study of various types of word order it has been discovered that not all languages group the relations between actors and actions as English do into Subject, Object and Verb - this type is called the <a href="/wiki/Nominative%E2%80%93absolutive_language" title="Nominative–absolutive language">nominative-accusative</a> type. Some languages called <a href="/wiki/Ergativity" title="Ergativity">ergative</a>, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish between Agents and Patients. In English transitive clauses, both the subject of intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun I. In ergative languages the single participant in an intransitive sentence such as I run is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence - giving the equivalent of "me run" and "you love me", only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun I be used.<a href="#cite_note-CroftErg-83">[84]</a> In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the <a href="/wiki/Tripartite_language" title="Tripartite language">tripartite type</a>.<a href="#cite_note-85">[86]</a></p><p>The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to the universal laws governing the structure of natural languages—language universals—or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.<a href="#cite_note-Myths-14">[15]</a></p><h2>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23" title="Edit section: Social contexts of use and transmission">edit</a>] Social contexts of use and transmission</h2><p>While all humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on <a href="/wiki/Speech_community" title="Speech community">communities of speakers</a> in which children <a href="/wiki/Language_acquisition" title="Language acquisition">learn language</a> from their elders and peers, and themselves transmit language to their own children.

Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.<a href="#cite_note-Myths-14">[15]</a> Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to <a href="/wiki/Language_contact" title="Language contact">language contact</a>.

But semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. However, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings depending on the social context of use. And signs also change their meaning over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions change depending on context is called pragmatics. Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example in all languages linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects. For example the act of 'naming', which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of 'pronouncing someone man and wife' which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called <a href="/wiki/Speech_act" title="Speech act">speech acts</a>, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing.<a href="#cite_note-88">[89]</a></p><p>The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks "can you reach the salt?", that is in fact not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken, these kinds of effects of meaning are called <a href="/wiki/Conversational_implicature" title="Conversational implicature">conversational implicatures</a>. These social rules for the ways in which certain ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations, and how to understand utterances in relation to their context, vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring <a href="/wiki/Communicative_competence" title="Communicative competence">communicative competence</a> in a language.<a href="#cite_note-89">[90]</a></p><h3>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25" title="Edit section: Language acquisition">edit</a>] Language acquisition</h3><p>All healthy, <a href="/wiki/Human_development_(biology)" title="Human development (biology)">normally-developing</a> human beings learn to use language.

From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different <a href="/wiki/Phone_(phonetics)" title="Phone (phonetics)">speech sounds</a>. Around six months of age, a child will begin <a href="/wiki/Babbling" title="Babbling">babbling</a>, producing the speech sounds or <a href="/wiki/Handshape" title="Handshape">handshapes</a> of the languages used around them.

A child's first <a href="/wiki/Utterance" title="Utterance">utterances</a> are <a href="/wiki/Holophrasis" title="Holophrasis">holophrases</a> (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea.

Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.</p><h3>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26" title="Edit section: Language and culture">edit</a>] Language and culture</h3><p>Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speak them. Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others. Even among speakers of one language several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly <a href="/wiki/Sociolinguistics" title="Sociolinguistics">sociolinguists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anthropological_linguistics" title="Anthropological linguistics">ethnolinguists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_anthropology" title="Linguistic anthropology">linguistic anthropologists</a> have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between <a href="/wiki/Speech_community" title="Speech community">speech communities</a>.<a href="#cite_note-Duranti2003-92">[93]</a></p><p>A community's way of using language is a part of the community's culture, just as other shared practices are; it is a way of displaying group identity. Ways of speaking function not only to facilitate communication, but also to identify the social position of the speaker. In many languages there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak. Just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example in the Australian language <a href="/wiki/Dyirbal_language" title="Dyirbal language">Dyirbal</a> a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother in-law.<a href="#cite_note-Foley-93">[94]</a></p><p>Linguists use the term "<a href="/wiki/Variety_(linguistics)" title="Variety (linguistics)">varieties</a>" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language.

For instance, in several languages of east Asia, such as <a href="/wiki/Thai_language" title="Thai language">Thai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Burmese_language" title="Burmese language">Burmese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Old_Javanese" title="Old Javanese">Javanese</a>, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.<a href="#cite_note-Foley_1997_p-94">[95]</a></p><h3>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27" title="Edit section: Writing, literacy and technology">edit</a>] Writing, literacy and technology</h3><p>Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented.

Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.<a href="#cite_note-96">[97]</a><a href="#cite_note-97">[98]</a></p><p>Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire <a href="/wiki/Phonological_change" title="Phonological change">phonological system</a>. <a href="/wiki/Sound_change" title="Sound change">Sound change</a> can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or <a href="/wiki/Distinctive_feature" title="Distinctive feature">phonetic feature</a> by another, or of the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there previously was none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a <a href="/wiki/Chain_shift" title="Chain shift">chain shift</a> in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the <a href="/wiki/Germanic_languages" title="Germanic languages">Germanic languages</a> when the sound change known as <a href="/wiki/Grimm%27s_law" title="Grimm's law">Grimm's law</a> affected all the stop consonants in the system.

The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why <a href="/wiki/Italic_languages" title="Italic languages">Italic languages</a> such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces whereas Germanic languages like English have father and fish.<a href="#cite_note-98">[99]</a></p><p>Another example is the <a href="/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift" title="Great Vowel Shift">Great Vowel Shift</a> in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation, this is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words, as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> madame and American English ma'am.<a href="#cite_note-99">[100]</a></p><p>Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as <a href="/wiki/Idiom" title="Idiom">idioms</a> or particular constructions become <a href="/wiki/Grammaticalized" title="Grammaticalized">grammaticalized</a>.

The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.<a href="#cite_note-100">[101]</a> Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full fledged future tense (e.g. I'm gonna).</p><p>Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish auditively or to produce, or because of certain patterns of change that cause certain rare types of constructions to <a href="/wiki/Drift_(linguistics)" title="Drift (linguistics)">drift</a> towards more common types.<a href="#cite_note-101">[102]</a> Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership of certain groups, such as social classes, or with <a href="/wiki/Language_ideology" title="Language ideology">ideologies</a>, and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas.

In areas where many languages are in close contact this may lead to the formation of <a href="/wiki/Sprachbund" title="Sprachbund">language areas</a> in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them: the <a href="/wiki/Balkan_language_area" title="Balkan language area">Balkan language area</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mesoamerican_language_area" title="Mesoamerican language area">Mesoamerican language area</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Ethiopian_language_area" title="Ethiopian language area">Ethiopian language area</a>.

In situations of extreme and sustained language contact it may lead to the formation of new <a href="/wiki/Mixed_language" title="Mixed language">mixed languages</a> that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called <a href="/wiki/Pidgins" title="Pidgins">pidgins</a> occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to learn to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure, the language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a <a href="/wiki/Creole_language" title="Creole language">creole language</a>. An example of such mixed languages are <a href="/wiki/Tok_Pisin" title="Tok Pisin">Tok Pisin</a> the official language of <a href="/wiki/Papua_New-Guinea" title="Papua New-Guinea">Papua New-Guinea</a> which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and <a href="/wiki/Austronesian_languages" title="Austronesian languages">Austronesian languages</a>; others are <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Creole" title="Haitian Creole">Kreyòl ayisyen</a> the French based creole language spoken in <a href="/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Michif_language" title="Michif language">Michif</a>, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language <a href="/wiki/Cree_language" title="Cree language">Cree</a> and French.<a href="#cite_note-107">[108]</a><a href="#cite_note-108">[109]</a></p><h2>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30" title="Edit section: Linguistic diversity">edit</a>] Linguistic diversity</h2><p>A "living language" is simply one which is in wide use as a primary form of communication by a specific group of living people.
