This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (<a>larynx</a>) and the upper vocal tract - the throat, the mouth and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.<sup><a><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of <a>segmental and suprasegmental</a> elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, and which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as <a>stress</a>, <a>phonation</a> type, voice <a>timbre</a> and <a>prosody</a> or <a>intonation</a> all of which may have effects across multiple segments.<sup><a><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p><a>Consonants</a> and <a>vowel</a> segments combine to form <a>syllables</a>, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations.<a>Acoustically</a>, these different segments are characterized by different <a>formant</a> structures, that are visible in a <a>spectrogram</a> of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.<sup><a><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.<sup><a><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> Vowels are called <i><a>close</a></i> when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel <span>[i]</span> (English "<i>ee</i>"), or <i><a>open</a></i> when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel <span>[a]</span> (English "<i>ah</i>"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth the quality changes, creating vowels such as <span>[u]</span> (English "<i>oo</i>"). And the quality also changes depending on whether the lips are <a>rounded</a> as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between <span>[i]</span> (unrounded front vowel such as English "<i>ee</i>") and <span>[y]</span> (<a>rounded front vowel</a> such as German "ü").<sup><a><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonants sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed - commonly at the lips, teeth, <a>alveolar ridge</a>, <i><a>palate</a></i>, <i><a>velum</a></i>, <i><a>uvula</a></i> or <i><a>glottis</a></i>. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by <a>manner of articulation</a> - the kind of friction - whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called <i><a>occlusive</a></i> or <i><a>stop</a></i>, or different degrees of aperture creating <i><a>fricatives</a></i> and <i><a>approximants</a></i>. Consonants can also be either <i><a>voiced or unvoiced</a></i>, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by the airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English <span>[s]</span> in <i>bus</i> (<a>unvoiced sibilant</a>) from <span>[z]</span> in <i>buzz</i> (<a>voiced sibilant</a>).<sup><a><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called <i><a>nasals</a></i> or <i><a>nasalized</a></i> sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called <i><a>laterals</a></i>, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called <i><a>rhotics</a></i>) that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.<sup><a><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages whereas others are much more common in certain language families, or language areas, or even specific to a single language.<sup><a><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h2><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Structure</span></h2><p>When described as a system of <a>symbolic communication</a>, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: <a>signs</a>, <a>meanings</a> and a <a>code</a> connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of <a>semiosis</a>, how signs and meanings are combined, used and interpreted is called <a>semiotics</a>. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed or written, and they can be combined into complex signs such as words and phrases. When used in communication a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.<sup><a><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup></p><div><div><div>
Ancient <a>Tamil</a> inscription at <a>Thanjavur</a></div></div></div><p>Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.<sup><a><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The rules under which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called <a>syntax</a> or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases and texts is called <a>semantics</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.<sup><a><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup></p><div>Main articles: <a>Semantics</a>, <a>Semiotics</a>, and <a>Meaning (linguistics)</a></div><p>Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example in sounds, images or gestures, and they come to be related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.</p><p>Thus languages must have a <a>vocabulary</a> of signs related to specific meaning—the English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species <i><a>Canis familiaris</a></i>. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the <a>lexicon</a>, and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a <a>lexeme</a>. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words - often semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of <a>grammatical categories</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>All languages contain the semantic structure of <a>predication</a>— a structure that predicates a property, state or action. Traditionally semantics has been understood as the study of how speakers and interpreters assign <a>truth values</a> to statements, so that meaning is understood as the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]." Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of <a>pragmatics</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h3><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Sounds and Symbols</span></h3><div>Main articles: <a>Phonology</a> and <a>Writing</a></div><div><div><div><div>A spectrogram showing the sound of the spoken English word "man" which is written phonetically as <span>[mæn]</span>. note that in flowing speech there is no clear division between segments, only a smooth transition as the vocal apparatus moves.</div></div><div><div>The letter "wi" in the <a>Hangul</a> script.</div></div><div><div>The sign for "wi" in <a>Korean Sign Language</a></div></div></div></div><p>Depending on modality language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages) or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in <a>phonology</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup> The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called <a>phonetics</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.<sup><a><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called <a>phonemes</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called <a>minimal pair</a>. In English for example the words <i>/bat/</i><span>[bat]</span> and <i>/pat/</i><span>[pʰat]</span> form a minimal pair in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates the two words as having different meanings. But each language contrasts sounds in different ways: for example in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants the sounds [p] and [b] would be considered a single phoneme and consequently the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between <a>aspirated and non-aspirated</a> pronunciations of consonants as many other languages do: the unaspirated /p/ in /<i>spin</i>/ <span>[spin]</span> and the aspirated /p/ in /<i>pin</i>/ <span>[pʰin]</span> are considered as merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called <a>allophones</a>), whereas in <a>Mandarin Chinese</a> the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words <span>[pʰá]</span> "crouch" and <span>[pá]</span> "eight" (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).<sup><a><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>All <a>spoken languages</a> have phonemes of at least two different categories, <a>vowels</a> and <a>consonants</a>, that can be combined to form <a>syllables</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use <a>stress</a>, <a>pitch</a>, <a>duration</a> and <a>tone</a> to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments they are called <a>suprasegmental</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup> Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example <a>Rotokas</a> and <a>Pirahã language</a> with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like <a>Taa</a> may have as many as 141 phonemes.<sup><a><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> In <a>sign languages</a><a>the equivalent to phonemes</a> (formerly called <a>cheremes</a>) are defined by the basic elements of gestures such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.<sup><a><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p><a>Writing systems</a> represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The <a>Latin alphabet</a> (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the <a>Inuktitut</a> syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In <a>logographic</a> scripts each sign represents an entire word,<sup><a><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.</p><p>Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the <a>Arabic script</a>), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others such as the ancient Maya script can be written in either direction and relies on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.<sup><a><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the <a>International Phonetic Alphabet</a>, designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.<sup><a><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup></p><div>Main article: <a>grammar</a></div><p>Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called <i><a>morphemes</a></i>, within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be <i>free</i> or <i>bound</i>. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called <i><a>words</a></i>, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called <a>affixes</a>. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules obtaining for the internal structure of words are called <a>morphology</a>. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called <i>syntax</i>.<sup><a><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h4><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Grammatical categories</span></h4><p>Grammar can be described as a system of categories, and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.<sup><a><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> Languages differ widely in whether categories are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically <a>distinguishing between their relations</a> to a predicate, the encoding of <a>temporal</a> and <a>spatial</a> relations on predicates, and a system of <a>grammatical person</a> governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.<sup><a><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h4><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Word classes</span></h4><p>Languages organize their <a>parts of speech</a> into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denote things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denote actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song," are usually called <a>nouns</a>. The second, which includes "run" and "sing," are called <a>verbs</a>. An other common category is the <a>adjective</a>, words that describe properties or qualities of nouns such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open", if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed", if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since infinite numbers of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix "noun-like"). In other languages such as <a>Korean</a> the situation is the opposite and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.<sup><a><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically verbs are used to construct <a>predicates</a>, while nouns are used as <a>arguments</a> of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs," the predicate is "runs," because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally." Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John." A predicate that can only take a single argument is called <a><i>intransitive</i></a>, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called <a><i>transitive</i></a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as <a>conjunctions</a> that serve to join two sentences and <a>articles</a> that introduces a noun, <a>interjections</a> such as "agh!" or "wow!", or <a>ideophones</a> that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals, that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have <a>classifiers</a> that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in <a>Japanese</a>, the general noun classifier for humans is <i>nin</i> (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:</p><dl><dd><i>san-nin no gakusei</i> (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student" — three students</dd></dl><p>While for trees, it would be:</p><dl><dd><i>san-bon no ki</i> (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree" — three trees</dd></dl><h4><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Morphology</span></h4><p>In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words, and the processes by which words are formed is called <a>morphology</a>. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several <a>morphemes</a>. For instance the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".<sup><a><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called <i><a>roots</a></i>, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or <i><a>affixes</a></i> can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: <i><a>prefixes</a></i> precede the root, <i><a>suffixes</a></i> follow the root and <i><a>infixes</a></i> are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example the English word "run" which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called <i><a>ablaut</a></i>. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of <i><a>inflection</a></i> which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of <i><a>derivation</a></i> which creates a new word from an existing one. In English the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung" which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer" which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".<sup><a><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example Chinese, there are no morphological processes and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called <a>isolating</a>, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example in Latin the word <i>bonus</i> "good" consists of the root <i>bon-</i> meaning "good" and the suffix -<i>us</i> which means masculine gender, singular number and <a>nominative</a> case. These languages are called <i><a>fusional languages</a></i>, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite type of fusional languages are <a>agglutinative languages</a> which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is <a>Turkish</a>, where for example the word <i>evlerinizden</i> "from your houses" consists of the morphemes, <i>ev-ler-iniz-den</i> with the meanings <i>house-plural-your-from</i>. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called <a>polysynthetic languages</a>. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example the <a>Yupik</a> word <i>tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq</i> which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer." The word consists of the morphemes <i>tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq</i> with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative, and except for the morpheme <i>tuntu</i> "reindeer", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.<sup><a><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called <i><a>agreement</a></i>. For example, in many Indo-European languages adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case and gender, so that the Latin adjective <i>bonus</i> "good" is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender and singular. In many polysynthetic languages verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example in the <a>Basque</a> phrase <i>ikusi nauzu</i> "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb <i>n-au-zu</i> (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the <i>n</i>- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the -<i>zu</i> suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"<sup><a><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup></p><div>Main article: <a>syntax</a></div><div><div><div>
In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the <a>subject</a> of the phrase, "on the mat" is a <a>locative</a> phrase, and "sat" is the core of the <a>predicate</a>.</div></div></div><p>Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. It is the syntactical rules of a language that determine why a sentence in English such as "<i>I love you</i>" is meaningful but "*<i>love you I</i>" is not<sup><a><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup>: syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.<sup><a><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, in English the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. But in <a>Latin</a> both <i>Dominus servos vituperabat</i> and <i>Servos vituperabat dominus</i> mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because <i>servos</i> "slaves" is in the <a>accusative case</a> showing that they are the <a>grammatical object</a> of the sentence and <i>dominus</i> "master" is in the <a>nominative case</a> showing that he is the subject.<sup><a><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of <a>inverse word order in questions</a> which exists in many languages. This rule is the reason that in English, when the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question it becomes "Who is John talking to?" and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing <a>special emphasis</a> on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called <a>phrases</a>, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.<sup><a><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup> To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analysed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase; and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.<sup><a><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The reason sentences can be seen as composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations are carried out. For example "the cat" is one phrase and "on the mat" is another because they would be treated as single units if we decided to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".<sup><a><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.<sup><a><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h3><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Typology: universals and diversity</span></h3><div>Main articles: <a>Linguistic typology</a>, <a>Language universals</a>, and <a>Universal Grammar</a></div><p>Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.<sup><a><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup> For example languages can be classified on the basis of their basic <a>word order</a>, the relative order of the <a>verb</a>, and its constituents in a normal indicative <a>sentence</a>. In English the basic order is <a>SVO</a> "<i>The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)</i>", whereas for example the corresponding sentence in the <a>Australian language</a><a>Gamilaraay</a> would be "<i>d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy</i>" (Snake Man Bit), <a>SOV</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup> Word order type is relevant as a typological parameters because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of prepositions of postpositions. Such correlations are called <a>implicational universals</a>. For example most (but not all) languages that are of the <a>SOV</a> type have <a>postpositions</a> rather than <a>prepositions</a>, and have adjectives before nouns.<sup><a><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Through the study of various types of word order it has been discovered that not all languages group the relations between actors and actions as English do into Subject, Object and Verb - this type is called the <a>nominative-accusative</a> type. Some languages called <a>ergative</a>, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish between Agents and Patients. In English transitive clauses, both the subject of intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun <i>I</i>. In ergative languages the single participant in an intransitive sentence such as I run is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence - giving the equivalent of "me run" and "you love me", only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun I be used.<sup><a><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup> In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the <a>tripartite type</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to the universal laws governing the structure of natural languages—language universals—or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.<sup><a><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h2><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Social contexts of use and transmission</span></h2><p>While all humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on <a>communities of speakers</a> in which children <a>learn language</a> from their elders and peers, and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to <a>communicate</a>, and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.<sup><a><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to <a>language contact</a>. The process is similar to the process of <a>evolution</a>, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a <a>phylogenetic tree</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>However, languages differ from a biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of <a>diffusion</a>, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their <a>first language</a> or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world many small languages are becoming <a>endangered</a> as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.<sup><a><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h3><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Usage and meaning</span></h3><div>Main article: <a>pragmatics</a></div><p>The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. But semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. However, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings depending on the social context of use. And signs also change their meaning over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions change depending on context is called pragmatics. Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example in all languages linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects. For example the act of 'naming', which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of 'pronouncing someone man and wife' which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called <a>speech acts</a>, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing.<sup><a><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks "can you reach the salt?", that is in fact not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken, these kinds of effects of meaning are called <a>conversational implicatures</a>. These social rules for the ways in which certain ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations, and how to understand utterances in relation to their context, vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring <a>communicative competence</a> in a language.<sup><a><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup></p><div>Main articles: <a>Language acquisition</a>, <a>Second-language acquisition</a>, <a>Second language</a>, and <a>Language education</a></div><div><div><div>
All normal children acquire language if they are exposed to it in their first years of life, even in cultures where adults rarely address infants and toddlers directly.</div></div></div><p>All healthy, <a>normally-developing</a> human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them – whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring <a>sign</a> or <a>oral languages</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup> This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In <i><a>The Descent of Man</a></i>, naturalist <a>Charles Darwin</a> called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art."<sup><a><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally-developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different <a>speech sounds</a>. Around six months of age, a child will begin <a>babbling</a>, producing the speech sounds or <a>handshapes</a> of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average <a>vocabulary</a> of an eighteen-month old child is around 50 <a>words</a>. A child's first <a>utterances</a> are <a>holophrases</a> (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, she or he will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months begin to produce <a>telegraphic speech</a>, short sentences that are less <a>grammatically</a> complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.<sup><a><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.</p><h3><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Language and culture</span></h3><div><div><div><a>Arnold Lakhovsky</a>, <i>The Conversation</i> (circa 1935)</div></div></div><p>Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speak them. Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others. Even among speakers of one language several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly <a>sociolinguists</a>, <a>ethnolinguists</a> and <a>linguistic anthropologists</a> have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between <a>speech communities</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>A community's way of using language is a part of the community's culture, just as other shared practices are; it is a way of displaying group identity. Ways of speaking function not only to facilitate communication, but also to identify the social position of the speaker. In many languages there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak. Just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example in the Australian language <a>Dyirbal</a> a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother in-law.<sup><a><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Linguists use the term "<a>varieties</a>" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined <a>dialects</a> as well as the <a>jargons</a> or <a>styles</a> of <a>subcultures</a>. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.<sup><a><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Languages do not differ only in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking". Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of "social <a>deixis</a>", systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.<sup><a><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> In English, social deixis is shown mostly though distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, but also in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor" or "Your Honor", but in other languages such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in several languages of east Asia, such as <a>Thai</a>, <a>Burmese</a> and <a>Javanese</a>, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.<sup><a><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h3><span>[<a>edit</a>]</span><span>Writing, literacy and technology</span></h3><div>Main articles: <a>Writing</a> and <a>Literacy</a></div><div><div><div>

These are called <a>writing systems</a>.</p><p>The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles and register in written and spoken language, and in some communities writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also have effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and <a>formal education</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the <a>Bronze Age</a> in the late <a>Neolithic</a> of the late <a>4th millennium BC</a>. The <a>Sumerian</a> archaic <a>cuneiform script</a> and the <a>Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about <a>2600 BC</a>. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of <a>cultural diffusion</a>.

The first page of the <a>Beowulf</a> poem written in <a>Old English</a> in the early medieval period (800 - 1100 AD). Although old English language is the direct ancestor of modern English language change has rendered it unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.</div></div></div><p>All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.<sup><a><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire <a>phonological system</a>. <a>Sound change</a> can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or <a>phonetic feature</a> by another, or of the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there previously was none. Sound changes can be <i>conditioned</i> in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be <i>regular</i>, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be <i>sporadic</i>, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a <a>chain shift</a> in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the <a>Germanic languages</a> when the sound change known as <a>Grimm's law</a> affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *<span>bʰ</span> became /b/ in the Germanic languages, and the previous *<span>b</span> in turn became /p/ and the previous *<span>p</span> became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why <a>Italic languages</a> such as Latin have <i>p</i> in words like <i><b>p</b>ater</i> and <i><b>p</b>isces</i> whereas Germanic languages like English have <i><b>f</b>ather</i> and <i><b>f</b>ish</i>.<sup><a><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Another example is the <a>Great Vowel Shift</a> in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation, this is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words, as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin <i>mea domina</i> to eventually become the <a>French</a><i>madame</i> and American English <i>ma'am</i>.<sup><a><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as <a>idioms</a> or particular constructions become <a>grammaticalized</a>. This frequently happen when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example in some varieties of <a>Caribbean Spanish</a> where word final /s/ has eroded away. Since <a>Standard Spanish</a> uses final /s/ is the morpheme marking the <a>second person</a> subject "you" on verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun <i>tú</i>. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is <i>¿como te llamas?</i><span>['komo te 'jamas]</span> in Standard Spanish, but <span>['komo 'tu te 'jama]</span> in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.<sup><a><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup> Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full fledged future tense (e.g. <i>I'm gonna</i>).</p><p>Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish auditively or to produce, or because of certain patterns of change that cause certain rare types of constructions to <a>drift</a> towards more common types.<sup><a><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup> Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership of certain groups, such as social classes, or with <a>ideologies</a>, and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.<sup><a><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></a></sup></p><div>Main articles: <a>Language contact</a>, <a>Pidgin</a>, <a>Creole language</a>, and <a>Sprachbund</a></div><p>One important source of language change is contact between different languages and resulting <a>diffusion</a> of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more <a>languages</a> or <a>varieties</a> interact on a regular basis.<sup><a><span>[</span>104<span>]</span></a></sup><a>Multilingualism</a> is likely to have been the norm throughout <a>human history</a>, and today most people in the world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the <a>ethno-national state</a>, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one, state and one language the most desirable political arrangement monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, so most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.<sup><a><span>[</span>105<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact this may lead to the formation of <a>language areas</a> in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them: the <a>Balkan language area</a>, the <a>Mesoamerican language area</a>, and the <a>Ethiopian language area</a>. Also larger areas such as <a>South Asia</a>, Europe and South East Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific <a>areal features</a>.<sup><a><span>[</span>106<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a><span>[</span>107<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including <a>language convergence</a>, <a>borrowing</a>, and <a>relexification</a> (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact it may lead to the formation of new <a>mixed languages</a> that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called <a>pidgins</a> occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to learn to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure, the language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a <a>creole language</a>. An example of such mixed languages are <a>Tok Pisin</a> the official language of <a>Papua New-Guinea</a> which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and <a>Austronesian languages</a>; others are <a>Kreyòl ayisyen</a> the French based creole language spoken in <a>Haiti</a>, and <a>Michif</a>, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language <a>Cree</a> and French.<sup><a><span>[</span>108<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></a></sup></p></div></div></div>
