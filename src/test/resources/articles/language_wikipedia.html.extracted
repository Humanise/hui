This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (<a href="/wiki/Larynx">larynx</a>) and the upper vocal tract - the throat, the mouth and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.<sup><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of <a href="/wiki/Segment_(linguistics)">segmental and suprasegmental</a> elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, and which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as <a href="/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)">stress</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phonation">phonation</a> type, voice <a href="/wiki/Timbre">timbre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)">prosody</a> or <a href="/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics)">intonation</a> all of which may have effects across multiple segments.<sup><a href="#cite_note-MacMahon5-46"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p><a href="/wiki/Consonant">Consonants</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vowel">vowel</a> segments combine to form <a href="/wiki/Syllable">syllables</a>, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations.<a href="/wiki/Acoustics">Acoustically</a>, these different segments are characterized by different <a href="/wiki/Formant">formant</a> structures, that are visible in a <a href="/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a> of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels).

But each language contrasts sounds in different ways: for example in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants the sounds [p] and [b] would be considered a single phoneme and consequently the two pronunciations would have the same meaning.

All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denote things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denote actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song," are usually called <a href="/wiki/Noun">nouns</a>. The second, which includes "run" and "sing," are called <a href="/wiki/Verb">verbs</a>. An other common category is the <a href="/wiki/Adjective">adjective</a>, words that describe properties or qualities of nouns such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open", if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed", if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since infinite numbers of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix "noun-like"). In other languages such as <a href="/wiki/Korean_language">Korean</a> the situation is the opposite and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.<sup><a href="#cite_note-69"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically verbs are used to construct <a href="/wiki/Predicate_(grammar)">predicates</a>, while nouns are used as <a href="/wiki/Argument">arguments</a> of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs," the predicate is "runs," because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally." Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John." A predicate that can only take a single argument is called <a href="/wiki/Transitivity_(grammar)"><i>intransitive</i></a>, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called <a href="/wiki/Transitive_verb"><i>transitive</i></a>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-70"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as <a href="/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar)">conjunctions</a> that serve to join two sentences and <a href="/wiki/Article_(grammar)">articles</a> that introduces a noun, <a href="/wiki/Interjections">interjections</a> such as "agh!" or "wow!", or <a href="/wiki/Ideophones">ideophones</a> that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals, that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have <a href="/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics)">classifiers</a> that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>, the general noun classifier for humans is <i>nin</i> (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:</p><dl><dd><i>san-nin no gakusei</i> (三人の学生) lit.

In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several <a href="/wiki/Morpheme">morphemes</a>. For instance the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".<sup><a href="#cite_note-71"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called <i><a href="/wiki/Root_(linguistics)">roots</a></i>, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or <i><a href="/wiki/Affix">affixes</a></i> can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: <i><a href="/wiki/Prefix">prefixes</a></i> precede the root, <i><a href="/wiki/Suffix">suffixes</a></i> follow the root and <i><a href="/wiki/Infix">infixes</a></i> are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example the English word "run" which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called <i><a href="/wiki/Ablaut">ablaut</a></i>. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of <i><a href="/wiki/Inflection">inflection</a></i> which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of <i><a href="/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics)">derivation</a></i> which creates a new word from an existing one. In English the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung" which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer" which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".<sup><a href="#cite_note-72"><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-73"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example Chinese, there are no morphological processes and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called <a href="/wiki/Isolating_language">isolating</a>, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example in Latin the word <i>bonus</i> "good" consists of the root <i>bon-</i> meaning "good" and the suffix -<i>us</i> which means masculine gender, singular number and <a href="/wiki/Nominative">nominative</a> case. These languages are called <i><a href="/wiki/Fusional_languages">fusional languages</a></i>, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite type of fusional languages are <a href="/wiki/Agglutinative_languages">agglutinative languages</a> which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is <a href="/wiki/Turkish_language">Turkish</a>, where for example the word <i>evlerinizden</i> "from your houses" consists of the morphemes, <i>ev-ler-iniz-den</i> with the meanings <i>house-plural-your-from</i>. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called <a href="/wiki/Polysynthetic_languages">polysynthetic languages</a>. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example the <a href="/wiki/Yupik_language">Yupik</a> word <i>tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq</i> which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer." The word consists of the morphemes <i>tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq</i> with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative, and except for the morpheme <i>tuntu</i> "reindeer", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.<sup><a href="#cite_note-74"><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called <i><a href="/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics)">agreement</a></i>. For example, in many Indo-European languages adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case and gender, so that the Latin adjective <i>bonus</i> "good" is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender and singular. In many polysynthetic languages verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example in the <a href="/wiki/Basque_language">Basque</a> phrase <i>ikusi nauzu</i> "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb <i>n-au-zu</i> (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the <i>n</i>- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the -<i>zu</i> suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"<sup><a href="#cite_note-75"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup></p>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a>
In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the <a href="/wiki/Subject_(grammar)">subject</a> of the phrase, "on the mat" is a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Locative_(case)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">locative</a> phrase, and "sat" is the core of the <a href="/wiki/Predicate_(grammar)">predicate</a>.<p>Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. It is the syntactical rules of a language that determine why a sentence in English such as "<i>I love you</i>" is meaningful but "*<i>love you I</i>" is not<sup><a href="#cite_note-76"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup>: syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.<sup><a href="#cite_note-77"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, in English the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. But in <a href="/wiki/Latin_language">Latin</a> both <i>Dominus servos vituperabat</i> and <i>Servos vituperabat dominus</i> mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because <i>servos</i> "slaves" is in the <a href="/wiki/Accusative_case">accusative case</a> showing that they are the <a href="/wiki/Object_(grammar)">grammatical object</a> of the sentence and <i>dominus</i> "master" is in the <a href="/wiki/Nominative_case">nominative case</a> showing that he is the subject.<sup><a href="#cite_note-78"><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of <a href="/wiki/Wh-movement">inverse word order in questions</a> which exists in many languages. This rule is the reason that in English, when the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question it becomes "Who is John talking to?" and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing <a href="/wiki/Focus_(linguistics)">special emphasis</a> on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called <a href="/wiki/Phrase">phrases</a>, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.<sup><a href="#cite_note-79"><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup> To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analysed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase; and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.<sup><a href="#cite_note-80"><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The reason sentences can be seen as composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations are carried out. For example "the cat" is one phrase and "on the mat" is another because they would be treated as single units if we decided to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".<sup><a href="#cite_note-81"><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.<sup><a href="#cite_note-NewmeyerForm-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h3><span>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22">edit</a>]</span><span>Typology: universals and diversity</span></h3>Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_typology">Linguistic typology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Language_universals">Language universals</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Universal_Grammar">Universal Grammar</a><p>Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types.

In English the basic order is <a href="/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">SVO</a> "<i>The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)</i>", whereas for example the corresponding sentence in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_languages">Australian language</a><a href="/wiki/Gamilaraay_language">Gamilaraay</a> would be "<i>d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy</i>" (Snake Man Bit), <a href="/wiki/Subject-object-verb">SOV</a>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-CroftErg-83"><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup> Word order type is relevant as a typological parameters because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of prepositions of postpositions. Such correlations are called <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_universals">implicational universals</a>. For example most (but not all) languages that are of the <a href="/wiki/Subject-object-verb">SOV</a> type have <a href="/wiki/Postposition">postpositions</a> rather than <a href="/wiki/Preposition">prepositions</a>, and have adjectives before nouns.<sup><a href="#cite_note-84"><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Through the study of various types of word order it has been discovered that not all languages group the relations between actors and actions as English do into Subject, Object and Verb - this type is called the <a href="/wiki/Nominative%E2%80%93absolutive_language">nominative-accusative</a> type. Some languages called <a href="/wiki/Ergativity">ergative</a>, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish between Agents and Patients. In English transitive clauses, both the subject of intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun <i>I</i>. In ergative languages the single participant in an intransitive sentence such as I run is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence - giving the equivalent of "me run" and "you love me", only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun I be used.<sup><a href="#cite_note-CroftErg-83"><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup> In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the <a href="/wiki/Tripartite_language">tripartite type</a>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-85"><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to the universal laws governing the structure of natural languages—language universals—or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Myths-14"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p><h2><span>[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Language&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23">edit</a>]</span><span>Social contexts of use and transmission</span></h2><p>While all humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on <a href="/wiki/Speech_community">communities of speakers</a> in which children <a href="/wiki/Language_acquisition">learn language</a> from their elders and peers, and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to <a href="/wiki/Communicate">communicate</a>, and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.<sup><a href="#cite_note-Myths-14"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to <a href="/wiki/Language_contact">language contact</a>.

But semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. However, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings depending on the social context of use. And signs also change their meaning over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions change depending on context is called pragmatics. Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example in all languages linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects. For example the act of 'naming', which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of 'pronouncing someone man and wife' which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called <a href="/wiki/Speech_act">speech acts</a>, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing.<sup><a href="#cite_note-88"><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks "can you reach the salt?", that is in fact not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken, these kinds of effects of meaning are called <a href="/wiki/Conversational_implicature">conversational implicatures</a>. These social rules for the ways in which certain ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations, and how to understand utterances in relation to their context, vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring <a href="/wiki/Communicative_competence">communicative competence</a> in a language.<sup><a href="#cite_note-89"><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup></p>Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Language_acquisition">Language acquisition</a>, <a href="/wiki/Second-language_acquisition">Second-language acquisition</a>, <a href="/wiki/Second_language">Second language</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Language_education">Language education</a>

From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds.

A child's first <a href="/wiki/Utterance">utterances</a> are <a href="/wiki/Holophrasis">holophrases</a> (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea.

Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker.

Although old English language is the direct ancestor of modern English language change has rendered it unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.<p>All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.<sup><a href="#cite_note-96"><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-97"><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire <a href="/wiki/Phonological_change">phonological system</a>. <a href="/wiki/Sound_change">Sound change</a> can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or <a href="/wiki/Distinctive_feature">phonetic feature</a> by another, or of the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there previously was none. Sound changes can be <i>conditioned</i> in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be <i>regular</i>, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be <i>sporadic</i>, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a <a href="/wiki/Chain_shift">chain shift</a> in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the <a href="/wiki/Germanic_languages">Germanic languages</a> when the sound change known as <a href="/wiki/Grimm%27s_law">Grimm's law</a> affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *<span>bʰ</span> became /b/ in the Germanic languages, and the previous *<span>b</span> in turn became /p/ and the previous *<span>p</span> became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why <a href="/wiki/Italic_languages">Italic languages</a> such as Latin have <i>p</i> in words like <i><b>p</b>ater</i> and <i><b>p</b>isces</i> whereas Germanic languages like English have <i><b>f</b>ather</i> and <i><b>f</b>ish</i>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-98"><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Another example is the <a href="/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift">Great Vowel Shift</a> in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation, this is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words, as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin <i>mea domina</i> to eventually become the <a href="/wiki/French_language">French</a><i>madame</i> and American English <i>ma'am</i>.<sup><a href="#cite_note-99"><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p><p>Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as <a href="/wiki/Idiom">idioms</a> or particular constructions become <a href="/wiki/Grammaticalized">grammaticalized</a>.

For example in some varieties of <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Spanish">Caribbean Spanish</a> where word final /s/ has eroded away. Since <a href="/wiki/Standard_Spanish">Standard Spanish</a> uses final /s/ is the morpheme marking the <a href="/wiki/Second_person">second person</a> subject "you" on verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun <i>tú</i>.

The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.<sup><a href="#cite_note-100"><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup> Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full fledged future tense (e.g. <i>I'm gonna</i>).</p><p>Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish auditively or to produce, or because of certain patterns of change that cause certain rare types of constructions to <a href="/wiki/Drift_(linguistics)">drift</a> towards more common types.<sup><a href="#cite_note-101"><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup> Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership of certain groups, such as social classes, or with <a href="/wiki/Language_ideology">ideologies</a>, and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas.

Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language.
